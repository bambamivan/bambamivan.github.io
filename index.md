## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting house prices using various machine learning techniques. The primary models used include Linear Regression and Random Forest. The project encompasses full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model evaluation. It aims to provide insights into the real estate market by predicting house prices based on various features.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and metrics.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.

## Features
- Comprehensive EDA to understand data patterns.
- Data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset.
- Implementation of Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and R¬≤.
- Visualizations to present findings and insights.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bambamivan/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
After setting up the project, open the Jupyter Notebook file to run the analysis. The notebook contains sections for EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` file.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells.

## Data Exploration
In this section, we conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset. Key steps include:

- **Loading the Data**: Importing the dataset using Pandas.
- **Data Overview**: Displaying the first few rows and summary statistics.
- **Missing Values**: Checking for and handling missing values.
- **Feature Distribution**: Visualizing the distribution of key features using histograms and box plots.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Using heatmaps to identify correlations between features and the target variable.

### Example Code for EDA
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/house_prices.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Visualize missing values
sns.heatmap(data.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Missing Values Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

## Modeling
The project implements two primary models: Linear Regression and Random Forest. Each model is trained and evaluated using the training and testing datasets.

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple yet effective model for predicting continuous values. The model is trained on the features and target variable, and predictions are made on the test set.

### Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy. It is particularly useful for handling complex datasets.

### Example Code for Modeling
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Split the data
X = data.drop('SalePrice', axis=1)
y = data['SalePrice']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Linear Regression
lr_model = LinearRegression()
lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Train Random Forest
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Evaluation
After training the models, we evaluate their performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R¬≤ score. These metrics provide insight into how well the models predict house prices.

### Example Code for Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Predictions
lr_predictions = lr_model.predict(X_test)
rf_predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation Metrics
lr_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, lr_predictions, squared=False)
rf_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, rf_predictions, squared=False)

print(f'Linear Regression RMSE: {lr_rmse}')
print(f'Random Forest RMSE: {rf_rmse}')
```
